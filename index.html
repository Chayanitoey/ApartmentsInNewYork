    This project was created in July 2021 as part of the workshop under the Data Visualization program at Parsons School of Design. 
    The results below are fetched from raw data acquired by the department of finance (DOF) in New York. 
    The Department of Finance (DOF) is required by NY State law to value condominiums or cooperatives as if they were residential rental apartment buildings.
    DOF uses income information from rental properties similar in physical features and location to the condominiums or cooperatives. This data set contains the reports from 2012-2018.
